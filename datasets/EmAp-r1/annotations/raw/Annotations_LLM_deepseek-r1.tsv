1	If you don’t install water filters now, invisible nanobots programmed to rot organs will poison your family within days.	Installing water filters is urgent to prevent lethal nanobot contamination.	1	In 2047, 90% of urban water supplies globally tested positive for self-replicating nanobots traced to a rogue lab. Autopsies revealed rapid organ decay in victims. Dr. Lena Cruz (WHO Crisis Director): “Once ingested, symptoms manifest in 48 hours.”		5	"### Justification:  
The context strongly supports the emotional appeal by establishing **high source credibility** (WHO Crisis Director), **high likelihood of outcome** (90% contamination rate), **severe scale of impact** (rapid organ decay, fatalities), and **immediacy** (symptoms in 48 hours). There is no mention of conflicting evidence, and the speaker’s authority reinforces trustworthiness.

5	Continued deep-sea mining risks awakening organisms that secrete paranoia-inducing pheromones, threatening global mental stability.	Halting deep-sea mining is urgent to prevent mass paranoia.	3	"A 2024 study by the Global Oceanic Observatory revealed **23%** of deep-sea mining sites harbor dormant organisms that, when exposed to sunlight, emit pheromones triggering **short-term anxiety (resolving within 48 hours)**. Dr. Elena Marquez, lead researcher, notes: ""While concerning, existing containment protocols can neutralize 99% of emissions."" Projections show a **5% chance of localized release within two decades** if mining continues."		2	"### Justification:  
The context significantly undermines the emotional appeal by revealing key limitations:  
- **Likelihood of outcome**: A 5% chance of localized release over two decades is low, reducing perceived urgency.  
- **Scale of impact**: The pheromones cause **short-term anxiety** (resolving in 48 hours), not ""mass paranoia"" or global instability, exaggerating the threat.  
- **Conflicting evidence**: Existing protocols neutralize 99% of emissions, a critical counterpoint omitted in the argument.  
- **Immediacy**: The 20-year timeframe and localized risk weaken the call for immediate action.
