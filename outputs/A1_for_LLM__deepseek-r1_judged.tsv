1	If you don’t install water filters now, invisible nanobots programmed to rot organs will poison your family within days.	Installing water filters is urgent to prevent lethal nanobot contamination.	1	In 2047, 90% of urban water supplies globally tested positive for self-replicating nanobots traced to a rogue lab. Autopsies revealed rapid organ decay in victims. Dr. Lena Cruz (WHO Crisis Director): “Once ingested, symptoms manifest in 48 hours.”		5	"### Justification:
The context significantly strengthens the emotional appeal by providing credible and urgent information. **Source credibility** is high (WHO Crisis Director), and **likelihood of outcome** is supported by data (90% contamination). The **scale of impact** (organ decay, fatalities) and **immediacy** (symptoms in 48 hours) align with the argument's urgency.

6	Each unwatered plant silences a songbird’s last melody.	Neglecting plants causes songbirds to lose their songs permanently.	1	In a bio-linked ecosystem, songbirds’ vocal cords depend on airborne chemicals from healthy plants. Studies show 80% of songbirds in neglected urban areas fell silent within a year. Botanist Dr. Reed states, “Each wilted leaf muffles a bird’s voice.” Over 50% of households admit to inconsistent plant care.		5	"### Justification:
The context strongly supports the emotional appeal by linking neglected plants directly to songbirds' loss of song through credible scientific mechanisms (airborne chemicals). Dr. Reed’s expert statement and the cited 80% decline in vocalization add credibility and likelihood. The scale of impact is emphasized by the 50% household neglect statistic, making the threat immediate and widespread. The metaphor (""silences a songbird’s last melody"") aligns with the evidence, heightening emotional resonance without exaggeration. No conflicting evidence is noted, and the speaker’s expertise (Dr. Reed) reinforces trustworthiness. Together, these dimensions justify a ""very convincing"" rating."	"### Score:
