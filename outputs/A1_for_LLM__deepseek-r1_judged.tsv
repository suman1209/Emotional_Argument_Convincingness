1	If you don’t install water filters now, invisible nanobots programmed to rot organs will poison your family within days.	Installing water filters is urgent to prevent lethal nanobot contamination.	1	In 2047, 90% of urban water supplies globally tested positive for self-replicating nanobots traced to a rogue lab. Autopsies revealed rapid organ decay in victims. Dr. Lena Cruz (WHO Crisis Director): “Once ingested, symptoms manifest in 48 hours.”		5	"### Justification:
The context strongly supports the emotional appeal by establishing **high source credibility** (WHO Crisis Director), **extreme likelihood** (90% contamination rate), **severe scale of impact** (organ decay, fatalities), and **urgent immediacy** (48-hour symptom onset). No conflicting evidence is mentioned, and the speaker’s authority bolsters trustworthiness. These elements align tightly with the argument’s urgency, making the emotional plea for immediate action highly convincing."	"### Score:

Installing water filters is urgent to prevent lethal nanobot contamination.	4	In 2047, 0.1% of urban water supplies globally showed trace amounts of inert nanobots, likely from industrial waste. Autopsies in rare cases noted mild stomach irritation, but peer-reviewed studies found no link to organ decay. Junior researcher Dr. Lena Cruz (WHO Waste Management Division): “Hypothetically, if active nanobots existed, symptoms *may* take weeks to appear.”		1	"### Justification:
The context significantly undermines the emotional appeal. The argument's claim of imminent lethal nanobot contamination is contradicted by evidence showing existing nanobots are **inert**, found in only **0.1% of water supplies**, and linked at most to mild stomach irritation—not organ decay. The likelihood of the warned outcome is extremely low, and the cited WHO researcher’s hypothetical scenario (symptoms taking **weeks**, not days) is misrepresented.
